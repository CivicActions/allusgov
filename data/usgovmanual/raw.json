In 1921, to improve managing the Nation's affairs, Congress passed the Budget and Accounting Act.

On October 21, 1796, while addressing some gentlemen in a letter from Mount Vernon, President George Washington conceived that \"a Botanical Garden would be a good appendage to the Institution of a University\" in the \"Federal City.\" Twenty-four years later, that conception blossomed, when President James Madison helped establish a botanic garden in the U.S. Capital under the auspices of the Columbian Institute, a society dedicated to promoting the arts and sciences. This early botanic collection served as the core of what would grow to become the Nation's future botanic garden."

Congress enacted that the enlarged collection should be placed under the stewardship of its Joint Committee on the Library and that it should be kept in the upper room of the Patent Office (5 Stat. 534)."

The Joint Committee on the Library, with supervision from the Commissioner of Public Buildings, managed the project (9 Stat. 427). A new national botanic garden opened on the National Mall, at the west end of the Capitol Grounds, later that year."

From the vice-presidency of John Adams in 1789 to that of Richard Nixon in the 1950s, presiding over the Senate was the chief function of the Vice President. Each one had an office in the Capitol, received staff support and office expenses through the legislative appropriations, and rarely was invited to participate in executive activities, including Cabinet meetings. In 1961, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson moved his chief office from the Capitol to the White House, directed his attention to executive functions, and started attending Senate sessions only at critical times. His actions changed the traditional role of the Vice President, and those changes continue in effect today."

In 1961, Vice President Lyndon B.

All these disruptions are the direct result of a climate straining under the heat-trapping burden of greenhouse gas pollution. The time to face this monumental challenge is now.\" The 2021 report notes the melting of frozen habitat that supports iconic animals like the polar bear and the arrival of new species like beavers, whose engineering activities create wetlands. The report also notes the nearly complete loss of old Arctic sea ice. Without the barricading presence of thick sea ice, ships and the industrial activities that they support are becoming more common in the Arctic. The effects include more garbage adrift and more pollution on shore, as well as higher levels of marine noise. Plastics and toxic chemicals are lethal threats to marine mammals such as seals, walrus, and whales. Undermining the food security of native communities, marine noise drives these magnificent mammals from their preferred habitats, which also are traditional hunting areas for indigenous hunters."

The global surface average for carbon dioxide during 2021 was 414.7 parts per million (ppm), which is an increase of 2.66 ppm over the 2020 average. This marks the 10th consecutive year that carbon dioxide increased by more than 2 parts per million, which represents the fastest sustained rate of increase in the 63 years since monitoring began.\" Summing up the recent research data, NOAA Administrator Richard W. Spinrad commented: “Our data show that global emissions continue to move in the wrong direction at a rapid pace. The evidence is consistent, alarming and undeniable. We need to build a Climate Ready Nation to adapt for what’s already here and prepare for what’s to come. At the same time, we can no longer afford to delay urgent and effective action needed to address the cause of the problem—greenhouse gas pollution."

The original idea and impetus for the HGP came from the DOE's Office of Science, which was then known as the Office of Energy Research. At the time, the sequencing of a whole human genome was considered a nearly impossible task. With the historical experience of large scientific endeavors that had started with the Manhattan Project, Office of Science personnel had the confidence that the task could be accomplished with sufficient Government resources. Interest in better understanding the genetic effects of radiation exposure stimulated the DOE's initial interest in undertaking this bold initiative."

A Government-furnished headstone or marker may be provided for eligible Veterans who died on or after Nov. 1, 1990 and whose grave is marked with a privately purchased headstone. A Government-furnished medallion may be provided for eligible Veterans who served on or after Apr. 6, 1917 and whose grave is marked with a privately purchased headstone or marker.

In addition to providing health care, VHA performs research, and assists in the education and training of physicians, dentists, and many other health care professionals through its affiliations with educational institutions and organizations. As of March 2017, VHA treated over 8.76 million patients in over 1,700 sites of care. VHA has 1,247 health care facilities, including 170 VA Medical Centers and 1,067 outpatient sites of care of varying complexity (VHA outpatient clinics). In addition, VA purchases medical care when needed from community providers including long-term services and supports in community nursing homes, State Veterans Homes, and in home and community based settings. In 2016, VA hospitals had about 621,520 inpatient admissions and provided nearly 84 million outpatient visits. In addition to care delivered in the VA system, VA also delivers care to millions of Veterans in the community. The number of women Veterans receiving health care from VA more than tripled between 2000 and 2016, growing from 160,000 in 2000 to 475,000.

This report identifies each of those schools by name and location, some of which operated across multiple sites.\" To conclude his letter, and with an eye on the future, he added: \"This report . . . is only a first step to acknowledge the experiences of Federal Indian boarding school children. It notes a desire from people across Indian Country and the Native Hawaiian Community to share their individual and family experiences within the Federal Indian boarding school system and the resulting impacts today. This report also presents an opportunity for us to reorient our Federal policies to support the revitalization of Tribal languages and cultural practices. This reorientation of Federal policy is necessary to counteract nearly two centuries of Federal policies aimed at the destruction of Tribal languages and cultures.\""

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) administers and enforces the internal revenue laws and related statutes, except those relating to alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives. It collects the proper amount of tax revenue, at the least cost to the public, by efficiently applying the tax law with integrity and fairness. The IRS aims for the highest possible degree of voluntary compliance in accordance with the tax laws and regulations; advises the public of their rights and responsibilities; determines the extent of compliance and the causes of noncompliance; properly administers and enforces the tax laws; and continually searches for and implements new, more efficient ways of accomplishing its mission. The IRS ensures satisfactory resolution of taxpayer complaints; provides taxpayer service and education; determines, assesses, and collects internal revenue taxes; determines pension plan qualifications and exempt organization status; and prepares and issues rulings and regulations to supplement the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code."

        "paragraph": "The OCC's role in the Federal banking system started in a tumultuous year, near the midpoint of the American Civil War. On January 1, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln emancipated over 3 million men, women, and children by signing the Emancipation Proclamation. Fifty-five days later, he added his signature to the National Currency Act, which established the OCC and charged it with responsibility for organizing and administering a system of nationally chartered banks and a uniform national currency. After 1913, its mission increasingly centered on the safety and soundness of national banks. To learn more about the agency's development over the past 155 years, see the \"Founding of the OCC and the National Banking System\" web page."

The two types of examinations conducted are for safety and soundness and for compliance with applicable consumer laws such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, and the Community Reinvestment Act.

The FDIC is required to resolve the closure in a manner that is least costly to its Deposit Insurance Fund. Ordinarily, the FDIC attempts to locate a healthy institution to acquire the failed entity. If such an entity cannot be found, the FDIC pays depositors the amount of their insured funds, usually by the next business day following the closure. Depositors with funds that exceed the insurance limit often receive an advance dividend, which is a portion of their uninsured funds that is determined by an estimate of the future proceeds from liquidating the failed institution's remaining assets. Depositors with funds in a failed institution that exceed the insurance limit receive a receivership certificate for those funds and partial payments of their uninsured funds as asset disposition permits."

It also issues enforcement actions, including cease-and-desist orders, for specific violations or practices requiring corrective action and reviews changes in ownership or control of a bank."

Three months later, in response to the crisis, President Roosevelt approved the Banking Act of 1933, giving birth to the FDIC and Federal depositor protection, which the general public supported.

Under normal economic conditions, the FOMC sets monetary policy by selecting an interest rate. To a bank, that interest rate is the cost of holding reserves. (Reserves are funds held by depository institutions as cash in their vaults or as deposits with their regional Federal reserve bank.) In recent years, the FRS has set a target, or target range, for the Federal funds rate, which is the interest rate that commercial banks charge each other for borrowing reserves for short periods. The open market desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York then conducts open market operations—buying or selling U.S. Treasury securities—to change the amount of reserves in the banking system to adjust the Federal funds rate. Since the Federal funds rate is the price of borrowing reserves, open market operations bring the actual Federal funds rate in line with the FOMC’s target. The strategy to vary the quantity or the price of reserves in the banking system defines FRS monetary policy."

The FRS supervises and regulates State member banks (State chartered banks that have chosen to become members of the FRS) and bank and financial holding companies (companies that own banks). The agency also supervises overseas and international operations of regulated financial institutions. Foreign banks with U.S. branches, agencies, and nonbank operations are also subject to supervision.

Traditionally, depository institutions sent the actual paper checks that they had received to reserve banks, which processed and routed them to the originating depository institution for collection. These institutions used their Federal reserve accounts to settle the transactions. Since enactment of the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, which is also cited as the Check 21 Act, institutions have been using electronic check clearing options. The Check 21 Act enabled reserve banks to employ electronic image-based solutions for the exchange of check data between depository institutions.

When the Government makes a payment by check or electronically, that payment is usually cashed by or deposited in a commercial bank or similar institution. The FRS processes the payment and deducts the amount from the Treasury's account. Although the Treasury usually keeps the money received from tax payments on deposit at commercial banks, it transfers funds to a Federal reserve bank as needed to make payments. The Federal Government has reduced costs and improved service to the public by using the FRS's electronic payments network.

When currency from the public flows back into depository institutions, those institutions deposit the surplus in their reserve banks. The Department of the Treasury designs and produces U.S. paper money and coin. As the Treasury produces currency, reserve banks put the new money into circulation to meet public needs. The FRS also destroys money that is no longer fit for circulation. By crediting the Government’s account, reserve banks “buy\" new paper money and coin from the Treasury to replace the notes that they destroy and coin that they return to the U.S. Mint."

While we do find that money-financed fiscal programs, if communicated successfully and seen as credible by the public, could provide significant stimulus, we underscore the risks that would be associated with such a program.\""

If no settlement is reached within 60 days following the creation of the PEB, the NMB is required to conduct a public hearing on the dispute. If there is no settlement within 120 days after the creation of the PEB, either party or the Governor of any affected state may request a second, final-offer PEB. No self-help is permitted pending the exhaustion of these emergency procedures."

The NMB is responsible for ensuring that the requirements for a fair election process have been maintained.

Grievance arbitration is a process for resolving disputes regarding the interpretation or application of an existing collective bargaining agreement. Grievances must be handled through grievance arbitration if not otherwise resolved, and they cannot be used by the parties to trigger self-help actions. The NMB has significant administrative responsibilities for grievance arbitration in the railroad industry, which includes those before the National Railroad Adjustment Board (NRAB), as well as the two types of arbitration panels established by the labor-management parties at each railroad: public law boards (PLBs) and special boards of adjustment (SBAs). Grievance arbitration in the airline industry is accomplished at the various system boards of adjustment created jointly by labor and management at the parties' expense. The NMB furnishes panels of prospective arbitrators for the parties' selection in both the airline and railroad industries. The NMB also pays the salary and travel expenses of the arbitrators for railroad arbitration proceedings. Grievance arbitration decisions are final and binding with very limited grounds for judicial review."

                "paragraph": "Interest arbitration is a process to establish the terms of a new or modified collective bargaining agreement through arbitration rather than through negotiations. Unlike grievance arbitration, its use is not statutorily required. The NMB offers the parties the opportunity to use binding interest arbitration when the agency has determined that further mediation efforts will not be successful. In addition, the parties may directly agree to resolve their collective bargaining dispute or portions of their dispute through interest arbitration. The NMB generally provides the parties with panels of potential arbitrators from which they choose an individual to resolve their dispute. In some instances, however, the parties agree to allow the NMB to appoint an arbitrator directly. Interest arbitration decisions are final and binding with very narrow grounds for judicial appeal."

Director Haines said, \"Ecological degradation and a changing climate will continue to fuel disease outbreaks, threaten food and water security, and exacerbate political instability and humanitarian crises. Although much of the effect of a changing climate on U.S. security will play out indirectly in a broader political and economic context, warmer weather can generate direct, immediate impacts—for example, through more intense, frequent, and variable extreme weather events, in addition to driving conflicts over scarce natural resources. The changing climate, conflict, and economic deprivation will drive vulnerable populations from their homes, heightening humanitarian needs and increasing the risk of political upheaval.\""

Global temperatures most likely will surpass the Paris Agreement goal of 1.5 [degrees] Celsius by around 2030, and the physical effects are projected to continue intensifying.\" As part of its Key Takeaway section, the report says: \"As a baseline, the [Intelligence Community] uses the US Federal Scientific community's high confidence in global projections of temperature increase and moderate confidence in regional projections of the intensity of extreme weather and other effects during the next two decades. Global temperatures have increased 1.1 [degrees] Celsius since pre-industrial times and most likely will add 0.4 [degree] Celsius to reach 1.5 [degrees] Celsius around 2030.\" The report also predicts that climate change will afflict the Nation with excessive heat, extreme storms, and flooding that \"will prove increasingly costly, require some military shifts, and increase demands for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations.\""

The required information about climate-related risks also would include disclosure of a registrant's greenhouse gas emissions. Commenting on the proposal, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said, \"If adopted, [the rule] would provide investors with consistent, comparable, and decision-useful information for making their investment decisions, and it would provide consistent and clear reporting obligations for issuers . . . . Our core bargain from the 1930s is that investors get to decide which risks to take, as long as public companies provide full and fair disclosure and are truthful in those disclosures. Today, investors representing literally tens of trillions of dollars support climate-related disclosures because they recognize that climate risks can pose significant financial risks to companies, and investors need reliable information about climate risks to make informed investment decisions.\""

If its determination is affirmative, the USITC recommends to the President action that would address the threat and be most effective in facilitating positive adjustment by the industry to import competition. The President determines if import relief is an appropriate response. The USITC also reports on developments within an industry that has been granted import relief. It advises the President of the probable economic effect of reducing or eliminating the tariff increase that was previously granted. The President may continue, modify, or terminate the import relief."

The conveyance of letters and intelligence was essential for winning the war for independence. A committee, which Benjamin Franklin chaired, was named to consider the creation of a postal system. The committee reported back to the Continental Congress in July of 1775. The Continental Congress agreed to the committee's recommendations, quickly created the position of Postmaster General, and named the committee's chair to fill the new position. Under Franklin and his immediate successors, the postal system mainly carried communications between Congress and the Continental Army. To ensure reliable service, postmasters and post riders were exempt from military duties. Franklin served as Postmaster General until November of 1776. He held the office when the Declaration of Independence created the United States in July of that year, which means that Franklin had the distinction of serving as the first Postmaster General of the United States. America's present Postal Service descends from the system Franklin placed in operation."

Rubenstein Family Giant Panda Habitat, where the giant pandas Mei Xiang and Tian Tian reside with their cub Bao Bao. Built to mimic the animals' natural habitat in China, it is part of the Zoo's Asia Trail, which also takes visitors through the habitats of red pandas, Asian small-clawed otters, fishing cats, sloth bears, and clouded leopards. Other highlights include the Elephant Trails, home to the Asian elephant Kandula, who was born at the Zoo in 2001; Amazonia, a 15,000-square-foot rain forest habitat; the Reptile Discovery Center, featuring African pancake tortoises and the world's largest lizards, Komodo dragons; and the Great Ape House, home to gorillas, orangutans, and other primates."

Kennedy, Congress designated the National Cultural Center as a \"living memorial\" to the slain President and authorized 23 million dollars to help build what is known today as the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Before the end of that year, enough artwork, building materials, and additional funds had been donated to start construction. With a gold-plated spade that had been used to break ground at both the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials, President Lyndon B. Johnson symbolically removed the first soil from the new site. The Center opened to the public in 1971, more than a decade after President Dwight D. Eisenhower and legislators, from both parties, had taken initial steps toward realizing this vision. To learn more about the people who imagined a cultural center for the Nation, those who supported its realization, and the emergence of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts as an iconic institution of the arts, visit the \"History\" Web page."

An extensive survey of Italian painting and sculpture, including the only painting by Leonardo da Vinci in the Americas, is on display in the Gallery. Rich in Dutch masters and French impressionists, the collection offers superb surveys of American, British, Flemish, Spanish, and 15th- and 16th-century German art, as well as Renaissance medals and bronzes, Chinese porcelains, and about 117,000 works of graphic art from the 12th century to the present day. The East Building collections and Sculpture Garden contain important works by major 20th-century artists. The Gallery relies on public and private resources. Federal appropriations support its operations and maintenance. Private donations and funds allow it to acquire artwork, as well as to offer a variety of special programs. For example, a fellowship program promotes graduate and postgraduate research, an extension service provides free education resources to millions of people each year, and other programs educate schoolchildren and the public."

The impacts of climate change are agonizingly unfair, with richer countries responsible for the historic build-up of greenhouse gases that cause climate change in the atmosphere, while climate change harms most those who can protect themselves least, including the poorest communities in the world’s fragile states. In addition, our responses to climate change can exacerbate inequities within and between countries. The agreement reached at Glasgow takes a big step in recognizing the world’s need to address these injustices. It elevates the global focus on seeking climate equity, and in particular intergenerational equity.\""

As a type of preface to the chapter's introduction, the authors wrote: \"Without further action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the planet is on course to reach temperatures not seen in millions of years, with potentially catastrophic implications. [Our analysis] suggests that an initial green investment push combined with steadily rising carbon prices would deliver the needed emission reductions at reasonable transitional global output effects, putting the global economy on a stronger and more sustainable footing over the medium term. Carbon pricing is critical to mitigation because higher carbon prices incentivize energy efficiency besides reallocating resources from high- to low-carbon activities. A green investment push up front would strengthen the macroeconomy in the short term and help lower the costs of adjusting to higher carbon prices. The transitional costs of carbon pricing consistent with net zero emissions by mid-century appear manageable and could be reduced further as new technological innovations develop in response to carbon pricing and green research and development subsidies. Governments can protect those most affected by mitigation by providing targeted cash transfers financed by carbon revenues.\""

The authors concluded their post \"Inflation to be Elevated for Longer on War, Demand, Job Markets\" with the following: \"[S]urging prices will have the greatest effects on vulnerable populations, particularly in low-income countries. High overall inflation will also complicate the trade-offs for central banks between containing price pressures and safeguarding growth. . . . While our baseline expectation is that inflation will eventually ease, inflation could turn out higher for several reasons. Worsening supply-demand imbalances . . . and further commodity-price gains could keep the pace of inflation persistently high. Moreover, both the [Ukraine] war and renewed pandemic flare-ups could prolong supply disruptions, further increasing costs of intermediate inputs. In a context of tight labor markets, nominal wage growth could also accelerate to catch up with consumer-price inflation as workers seek higher wages to preserve their purchasing power. This would further intensify and broaden inflation pressures, with the risk of de-anchoring inflation expectations.\""

Even prior to the war, it surged on the back of soaring commodity prices and supply-demand imbalances. Many central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, had already moved toward tightening monetary policy. War-related disruptions amplify those pressures. We now project inflation will remain elevated for much longer. In the United States and some European countries, it has reached its highest level in more than 40 years, in the context of tight labor markets. The risk is rising that inflation expectations drift away from central bank inflation targets, prompting a more aggressive tightening response from policymakers. Furthermore, increases in food and fuel prices may also significantly increase the prospect of social unrest in poorer countries.\""

An effective vaccine rollout has put the number of new COVID–19 cases on a firmly downward path. At the same time, unprecedented fiscal support is quickly restoring the economy back to full employment and generating positive outward spillovers to the world economy. These efforts have not been costless: the path for public debt is far higher; the current account deficit has grown; and very accommodative financial conditions have led to increased corporate and nonbank leverage and rising valuations across a range of assets. The pandemic continues to weigh heavily on those at the lower end of the income distribution, exposing longstanding inequities in access to quality healthcare and education (many of which have an important gender and racial dimension).\""
