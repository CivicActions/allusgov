IHS offers clinicians extraordinary opportunities for providing comprehensive care to a medically underserved patient population within culturally diverse Native communities. IHS clinicians live and practice in some of the most spectacular Areas of the country, in rural locations where there is great demand for generalists in clinical settings, as well as for specialists in hospital settings. IHS offers three employment options: Clinicians can join IHS as federal civil service employees, as direct Tribal/Urban Indian hires or as officers of the US Public Health Service (USPHS) Commissioned Corps. Each path offers generous vacation, sick leave, benefit and retirement packages, as well as possibilities for sign-up bonuses. Clinicians are also eligible to apply for the IHS Loan Repayment Program, which repays eligible health profession education loans \u2014 up to $20,000 per year \u2014 for a two-year service commitment at an eligible site within their health profession discipline. \r\n",
